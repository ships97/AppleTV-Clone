# Apple TV Clone

## Description
Hi Everyone, This project is a cloning site of Apple TV+. It is my second solo project and part of Construct week of Unit 4.  

Apple TV+ is a streaming service from Apple. It features exclusive Apple Original shows and movies from some of the industry's top talent and watch premieres of your 
favourite movie, tv shows.

Several issues arose during my project, including carousel and mobile responsiveness, but I was able to accomplish my solo project with the support of Google and YouTube.
I tried to give my website some common functionalities such as Carousel Sliding, Tab Switching, Hover Effects, Mouse Effect, TV Shows pages, SignUp Page and SignIn page.
I had a time frame of four days. I completed my project and put efforts from my side as much as possible.
